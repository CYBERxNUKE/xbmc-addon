# SportsDevil

This unofficial addon searches and reproduces streams from public Internet sites that charge for the viewing of their streams through web banner advertising or otherwise. SportsDevil is intended for those who have clicked on endless ads but cannot access the stream due to faulty web site setups. **SportsDevil does not provide or host any streams of its own; stream quality, content and copyright are responsibility of the ad-financed source web sites.**
