We are really glad you're reading this, because we need volunteer developers to help allof our project come to fruition.

If you haven't already, come find us in the forums [TVADDONS Forum](https://www.tvaddons.ag/forums). We want you working on things you're excited about

Please send a  Pull Request to TVADDONS with a clear list of what you've done  We can always use more test coverage. 

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:
____________________________________________________
$ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit


A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

Also , if your request has several altered files , you may submit a merge request that includes all changed files so as long as they are all altering the same issue.
otherwise please submit a seperate PR for each "issue"

PLEASE do not alter the addon.xml file as we will adjust and bump the version when we are ready to make a official release.
