- "Folder" scrapers now require you to name them to be included in a scrape when enabled.
- Unfortunately a third partial re-write of sources code.
- Added brief pause to Fen widget making to try and get around a reuselanguageinvoker Kodi bug where the widgets disappear when refreshed, usually after playback ends. Might work, might not. EDIT: Didn't work. Removed next update.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 2.5.19[/B][/COLOR]
- Unfortunately, another partial re-write of sources code due to an error I discovered after the previous update.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 2.0.20[/B][/COLOR]
- MANY settings/features removed for this update. Roll back to previous version and turn off auto updates if this is an issue. Or of course use a different addon.
- Changed "Filter Results By Size". Now you set your internet line speed rather than a min/max setting. Fen will determine on a per scrape basis the maximum filesize to include based on your internet speed and the reported duration of the movie/tvshow. There is now no way to set a minimum size.
e.g. If you input 20 Mbit/s as your internet speed, Fen will use the max speeds for different length videos as follows:
Length 10min = ~1.35 Gig, Length 30mins = ~4 Gig, Length 60 mins = ~8 Gig, Length 90min = ~12.5 Gig, Length 120min = ~16.2 Gig etc...
Fen will calculate these sizes using 90% of your overall internet speed (the amount you enter in settings).
- Added setting to have Fen scrape using ALL Fenomscraper scrapers instead of just the ones currently set to be used. If you get no results on a scraper search, you can select this to run a scrape with all the scrapers Fenomscrapers has. You can choose to do this from the "Options..." context menu.
- Added setting to enable/disable the Autoplay Next Episode window, if set to OFF you only receive a brief notification when the next episode is ready to be played. Found in Settings->Playback->Episodes->"Show Next Episode Window". Default is ON.
- Fixed Next Episode error in certain circumstances.
- Other changes/fixes.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 2.0.18[/B][/COLOR]
- Trailer playback from Widgets with auto-open Extras enabled will now play in Kodi's default player window, meaning it won't crash Kodi anymore. Unfortunately, it also means Fen's skinned videoplayer window will not be used. I am still searching for a better solution to this problem.
- Other changes/fixes.
