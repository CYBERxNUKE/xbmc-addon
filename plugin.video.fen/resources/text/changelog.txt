[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 3.0.16[/B][/COLOR]
- Root Menu item "Settings" merged into "Tools" menu.

- Other changes/fixes.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 3.0.13/14[/B][/COLOR]

- Added "Results Progress Style" to Settings->Results->Display. Options are Fullscreen/Dialog. Default "Fullscreen".
- Added "Trending Recent" to Movie & TV Show menus. Bring to your menus by either context menu->Edit Menu->Check if Menu has New Menu items or simply restore the menu to default.

- Removed "Enable Animations for Extras Window" setting. Animations ON always now.

- Other changes/fixes.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 3.0.09[/B][/COLOR]
- [COLOR red][EXPERIMENTAL...DISABLE IF CAUSING ISSUES.][/COLOR] Added "Open Fen Options Window Instead of Kodi Context Menu" to Settings->General->General. When enabled, Fen will attempt to open it's "Options..." dialog in place of Kodi's regular context menu. This will allow one-click access to items in the Options dialog. Only works on Fen media items, so a regular context menu will still appear at all other times. OFF by default.
- [COLOR red][EXPERIMENTAL...DISABLE IF CAUSING ISSUES.][/COLOR] Added "Open Fen Extras Window Instead of Kodi Info Dialog" to Settings->General->General. When enabled, Fen will attempt to open it's "Extras" window in place of Kodi's regular Info Dialog. Only works on Fen media items, so a regular info dialog will still appear at all other times. OFF by default.
- Re-added support for mixed Trakt lists. Mixed Movie/TV Show lists are supported.
- Added new source results view type "Media List". Change source results viewtypes in Settings->Results->Display->"Results Display", or within the "Options..." menu.

- Added "Max. HEVC Quality" & "Max. Autoplay HEVC Quality" to Results->Sorting & Filtering->HEVC Files Filter. If you choose to "Include" or "Prefer" HEVC files, you can now set the maximum quality for both Source Select & Autoplay. This will allow hardware with a maximum limit of software decoding HEVC files to limit the quality returned. Default is "4K".
- Fixed PACK browsing/downloading through Real Debrid.
- A reworking of aspects of the Extras and People custom windows.
- Other changes/fixes.

- Added startup task to hopefully clean settings file of offending setting and stop Kodi crashing.

- "In Progress TV Shows" will now honor your Trakt hidden list if you are using trakt. Meaning if you have hidden a show's progress on Trakt, it will no longer display in this menu.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 3.0.06[/B][/COLOR]
- Looks like Kodi decided on some installs that it doesn't like a setting type being changed. Changed name of setting to hopefully fix this.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 3.0.05[/B][/COLOR]
- Added "Include Adult Content" setting to Settings->Metadata->Filter. ON by default. The presumption of whether a piece of media is defined as "adult content" is determined by the metadata provider, TMDb.
- "Ignore All Filters When No Results Available" in Settings->Results has changed. You can now choose between "Off", "Auto" or "Prompt".

[COLOR=red][B]Changes during the downtime of Fen.[/B][/COLOR]
- Moved "Trakt Lists Manager" and "Favorites Manager" to within the "Options..." context menu list.
- Changed "Trakt" button in Extras Window to open "Options" instead. As above, the Trakt Lists Manager is now within the Options list.
- Changed a decent amount of resolving code. Let me know if any issues.
- Increased Reviews in "Extras" window to 75 items, if available.
- Fixed "Discover", which had a few errors floating about. Also, partial re-write performed.
- Fixed Uncached results not showing if enabled in settings, but no cached results found. Also added yes/no dialog to see uncached results if no cached results found and show uncached setting disabled.
- Added options for "Add Resolved Torrents to Cloud" for RD/PM & AD. Options are "None", "All" and "Show Packs Only".
- Added clearlogos from TMDb as either the main, or as a fallback when fanart.tv has no clearlogo.
- "Recommended" & ("Play Random", "Browse" & "Browse Season" for TV Shows) moved to "Options..." context menu item.
- Made some changes to Next Episode "On Deck" notification window.
- Made some under the hood changes to marking watched and marking progress behavior.
- Removed ability to set "Alphabet" to be used with Jump To...". Jumping to a certain page is now the only way to use "Jump To...".
- Removed multi-year search string from Easynews. Caused issues with some movie titles.
- Added "Use Fanart Background for Scraper Progress Display" to Settings->Results->Display.
- Added "Scrape with an Alias" to Playback Options. If aliases are available from the metadata, then you can choose for Fen to scrape using one of the aliases.
- Added "keyart" to metadata from fanart.tv. You will need to clear the metacache if you wish to see keyart immediately.
- Sources Folders now managed through Tools->Sources Folders Manager.
- Some minor changes to Extras window animations.
- Quick fix "In Progress Episodes".
- Added "Recently Watched" to Movies menu and "Recently Watched Episodes" to TV Show menu. Either select Edit Menu->Check If Menu has New Menu Items or Edit Menu->Restore Menu to Default in the Movie and TV Show menus to load the new menu items.
- Added "Scrape with DEFAULT external scrapers" to Options. Use this if you have only a couple of scrapers enabled, don't get any results, but also don't want to enable ALL scrapers to get results. This will load the FenomScrapers "default" scrapers for that single scrape.
- Added ability to scroll through Reviews/Trivia/Blunders in Extras window when viewing fullscreen.
- Added "Disable Content Lookup Before Playback". If this is enabled, it will prevent Kodi from asking for file info from Headers before starting playback. The hope is this will help with Easynews playback..
- Added "Release Date" to Trakt Collection & Watchlist sorting options in Navigation->Sorting.
- Added the ability to choose an icon for a shortcut folder when adding it to a list.
- Added "Custom Fen Windows Highlight Color" to Settings->General. Here you can set the color Fen custom windows use for highlights. Default "dodgerblue". If you know the HEX value of the color you want to use, you can input that instead of a default color.
- Moved all icons that Fen uses to online to decrease the size of the addon. Kodi caches all images after first download, so there will be no decrease in performance.
- Contents of Trakt user lists (other people's) now cleared on each Trakt Sync. Previously the cache was only cleared on each Kodi start.
- Fixed TV Shows. Oops.
- Fixed certain Trakt lists not working.
- Some code changes to "Monitor Successful Playback".
- Added Settings->Playback->"Monitor Successful Playback" for video playback. This will mainly be advantageous to users running Easynews, which often resolves but Kodi cannot start playback of the resolved file. If enabled, there will be a setting for the amount of time to wait for success before deeming it a failed playback.
- Added setting "Disable SSL Connections" to Settings->Providers->Furk. Furk seems to be having issues with some of their server's SSL Certificates. Setting this to ON will force Fen to use a "http" connection when attempting playback of Fen sources.
- Added "Discovery+" to TV Show Networks.
- Fixed "Scrape With Filters Disabled" to include not running Title Checks on Internal Scrapers when selected.
- Changes to Hybrid and HDR source detection, thanks to 123Venom and Gaiaaaiaai.

- Fixed "Multiselect..." Genres item when used through a widget.
- Added "Size Sort Order" setting for Results. Set to Descending (smallest to largest) or Ascending (largest to smallest).
