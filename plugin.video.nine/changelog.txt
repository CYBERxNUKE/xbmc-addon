  prevent it from locking the scraping process when a debrid service is down

[B][COLOR gold]v4.03.00-1[/COLOR][/B]
- Cosmetic updates
- Default trailer search method changed to IMDb, as it doesn't require the

[B][COLOR gold]v4.02.05[/COLOR][/B]
- Added yet another trailer/related videos source to choose: IMDb
  This source does not require the YouTube add-on to work

[B][COLOR gold]v4.02.04[/COLOR][/B]

- Removed Openscrapers support
    Causes unsolvable installation issue in the case of Kodi 18 to 19 upgrade
    and openscrapers was already installed.

[B][COLOR gold]v3.5.005-6[/COLOR][/B]
- Minor fixes

[B][COLOR gold]v3.5.004[/COLOR][/B]
- Attempt to fix error when upgrade Kodi 18 to 19 has occured and
    openscrapers package was already installed
    NOTE: Openscrapers is not Kodi 19 compatible so can't be used.

[B][COLOR gold]v3.5.000[/COLOR][/B]
- Removed MetaHandler dependency. Local indicators are now handled internaly.
    [I]NOTE:[/I] Unfortunately, due to this, all [I]local[/I] watched statuses and resume
    points will reset. This was necessary for several reasons:
    Metahandler was doing unnecessary API calls, fetching information we already had -
    it was actually not needed, a leftover from Genesis days.
    There are various versions of it floating around, some (kinda) working, some don't.
    It's also not compatible with Kodi 19, and will stop working once tvdb v1 API phases out.

- Updated cloudflare scraper from source

[B][COLOR gold]v3.4.011[/COLOR][/B]

    Also Trakt scrobbles now properly stop upon finishing playback

[B][COLOR gold]v3.4.009[/COLOR][/B]
- Search queries tweaks

[B][COLOR gold]v3.4.007-8[/COLOR][/B]

[B][COLOR gold]v3.4.002[/COLOR][/B]

[B][COLOR gold]v3.3.9[/COLOR][/B]
- Kodi 19 fix

[B][COLOR gold]v3.3.7-8[/COLOR][/B]
- Re-arranged source fetching and filtering (internally) for more accuracy on source
    counting, and pre-emptive termination to take into account more filters (WiP)
- Personal Fanart.tv API key is now required to be entered in settings, in order to fetch
    extra and hq artwork
    That was done due to some add-ons (like fake-exodus from kodibae, and pressplay) cloning
    Nine, along with the add-on's hard-coded API keys

[B][COLOR gold]v3.3.6[/COLOR][/B]
- Minor tweaks to previous commits

[B][COLOR gold]v3.3.5[/COLOR][/B]
- Added option to enable/disable size filtering
    If you already use size filtering you'll have to enable this option, as it's off by default

- Added option to enable/disable Trakt episodes ratings
    [I]Context:[/I]  TheTVDb stopped supporting ratings some time ago, so we resorted to Trakt
    for episodes ratings. But this takes an extra call to Trakt, which slows down the episodes
    list fetching. Now there's an option to turn this on/off - until a better solution is found.
- Made Channels main menu item optional

[B][COLOR gold]v3.2.7[/COLOR][/B]
